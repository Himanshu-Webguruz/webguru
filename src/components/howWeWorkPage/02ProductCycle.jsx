                          Every great project starts with a deep understanding.
                          In our first consultation, we take the time to learn
                          about your business goals, target audience, and
                          expectations. We ask questions, discuss ideas, and
                          gather insights to help us see the project through
                          your eyes. This stage helps establish a shared vision
                          and set clear objectives, forming a solid foundation
                          for success.
